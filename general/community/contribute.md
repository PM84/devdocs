If you want to contribute to Moodle, you can start looking at the following:

- **Found a bug?** [Report an issue](../development/tracker.md#reporting-an-issue) in our bug tracker.
- **Want to learn and extend your Moodle development skills**? Sign up to free self-paced courses in our [Moodle Academy Developer Learning Pathway](https://moodle.academy/course/index.php?categoryid=4).
- **Ready to help coding**? Check the [getting started](../development/gettingstarted.md) page.
- **Share your plugins** in the [Plugins directory](https://moodle.org/plugins).
- **Adopt an existing plugin**. Look at the [list of plugins seeking a new maintainer](https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=61) and read the [Plugins adoption programme](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=260354).
- **Assist with the translation** of Moodle. See [Translation](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Translation) page.
- **Get involved in the developer resources**, [contributing](../documentation/contributing.md) for fixing typos and errors, migrating pages, expanding the content, etc.

:::tip Searching for other ways to contribute?

You'll find them in the [How do I contribute to Moodle?](https://moodle.com/faq/how-do-i-contribute-to-moodle/) page.

## Where to begin

- Start by [searching moodle.org](http://moodle.org/public/search/) to check whether someone else has had the same idea. The Moodle community is very large, so it's quite likely you'll find someone else with the same idea as you ;-)
- Join an existing discussion about your idea, or start a new discussion in an [appropriate forum on moodle.org](http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=5).
- Assuming others agree with your idea, [create a new issue in the Moodle tracker](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa), selecting 'New feature' or 'Improvement' as the issue type. (You'll need to create a tracker account to be able to create a new issue.) Include a link to the discussion thread in the tracker issue.
- Post the tracker issue number in the discussion thread, to encourage others to watch, vote, comment and/or come up with a patch for it.

## What happens next?

- The [list of most voted-for new features](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10512) is regularly reviewed by Moodle HQ and other core developers.
- Promising ideas are added to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) (depending on funding availability).
- Small feature ideas and improvements may be added to core by the component maintainer.

## How to maximize the chance of your idea being implemented

Ideas with lots of votes are more likely to be implemented, however votes are not the only deciding factor.

- If you're able to provide funding for your idea to be implemented, please contact a [Moodle Partner specializing in custom development](http://moodle.com/partners/).
- Alternatively, you could join the [Moodle Users Association (MUA)](https://moodleassociation.org/) and propose your idea there. Note that the MUA will transition to
  the [Moodle LMS Community Product Advisory Group](https://moodleassociation.org/mod/page/view.php?id=1320).
- If you're a developer and can create a patch for your feature idea or improvement,
  please attach it to the tracker issue for review by the component maintainer. When you add a patch, add a "patch" label so your patch will be found in searches.
- Moodle is very modular, so the easiest way for new developers to implement are [new modules and plugins](https://moodle.org/plugins/)
