## Major Features

### Gradebook

Our main focus has been on the Gradebook, with improved UI based on community workshops, surveys and bug reports.

#### New Grader report (the main interface showing all grades):

- Uses the whole window
- Smooth, stable scrolling in all directions
- Works on all platforms, including phones and tablets
- [MDL-18229](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-18229) - A new [Single view](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Single_view) mode allows editing of any row or column on its own
- Allows quick editing of any cell without reloading.

#### New Natural weighting aggregation method

- [MDL-43378](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-43378) - Combines grades simply
- Clearer interface for using weights
- Supports extra credit, excluded grades, hidden grades
- Can remove the need to use any other aggregations

#### New Grade history report

- [MDL-46191](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46191) - A [grade history report](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Grade_history) lists full details of all grade changes

#### Improved Grader setup page (for defining items and categories)

- New design
- Easier terminology and clearer layout
- Bugs fixed relating to how grades are added in some scenarios
- Prevents loss of data when you leave the window
- Note! there are new admin settings that hide parts of the user interface. For example calculated grades are disabled by default (even if you were using them in Moodle 2.7 before you upgraded). If you use 'advanced' gradebook features, then after you upgrade, go to Site administration > Grades > Report settings > Grader report and check that the settings like Show calculations match your needs. (These settings affect the whole gradebook, not just the Grader report.)

#### Improved User report

- Clearer calculations
- [MDL-47064](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47064) - Contributions column explains grade calculations
